# François Guérin

Url: [francoisguerin.me](francoisguerin.me)

A simple page presenting the work of Montreal author François Guérin.

I made this page primarily to practice some new skills. I used the following technologies:

- CSS3 / Sass;
- HTML5;
- Vue js;
- Gridsome (as a static site generator);
- Formspree for the contact form;
- Deployed on Netlify.

Overkill? Absolutely. But it was good practice!

Enjoy the page, and I highly recommend reading the books presented on it.
