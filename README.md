## What is it?

A simple page presenting the work of french-canadian Montreal author François Guérin. The page is in french. Enjoy it, and I highly recommend reading the books!

I made this page primarily to practice some new skills. 

Users can:
- Click on the book covers to display the synopsis;
- Contact the author via the contact form at the bottom of the page.
